# rust-webxr

[![Build Status](https://github.com/servo/webxr/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/servo/webxr/actions)

A safe Rust API that provides a way to interact with virtual reality and augmented reality devices and integration with vendor-specific APIs like OpenVR, Oculus, Google VR, and Magic Leap. The API is inspired by the WebXR Device API (https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/) but adapted to Rust design patterns.

It's used in the WebXR implementation for the Servo browser, but can be used outside of Servo.

Some notes on our plans for this API: https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Rust-webxr-plans--Ad8iXHKI15DKsFhfT3ufGiQiAg-xmqpUtCzy8yNMGWwUUxsz
